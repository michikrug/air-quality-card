## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=KadenThomp36&repository=air-quality-card&category=plugin)

Or manually: open HACS, search for "Air Quality Card", click Install, and refresh your browser.

### Manual Installation

1. Download `air-quality-card.js` from the latest release
2. Copy it to `/config/www/air-quality-card/air-quality-card.js`
3. Add the resource in Home Assistant:
   - Go to Settings → Dashboards → Resources
   - Add `/local/air-quality-card/air-quality-card.js` as a JavaScript Module

## Configuration

### Using the Visual Editor

1. Add a new card to your dashboard
2. Search for "Air Quality Card"
3. Configure the entities using the visual editor
4. Primary sensors (CO₂, PM2.5, Humidity, Temperature) are always visible
5. Expand "Additional Sensors" for CO, HCHO, tVOC, PM1, PM10, PM0.3
6. Expand "Outdoor Sensors" for comparison data

### Outdoor Sensors

Configure outdoor sensor entities to see a **dashed comparison line** on each graph showing outdoor conditions alongside indoor readings. When outdoor sensors are configured:

- A subtle dashed line appears on the corresponding graph
- Hovering shows both indoor and outdoor values
- Current outdoor values appear next to indoor readings
- **Smart recommendations** avoid suggesting ventilation when outdoor air is worse (e.g., "Keep Windows Closed" instead of "Open Window")

## Built-in Recommendations

The card automatically generates actionable recommendations based on your sensor readings — no template sensors needed. It evaluates CO, CO2, PM2.5, PM10, HCHO, tVOC, and humidity levels, and when outdoor sensors are configured, it avoids suggesting ventilation when outdoor air is worse.

**CO safety alerts** are always shown regardless of outdoor conditions — carbon monoxide is a life-safety concern. If CO exceeds dangerous levels, the card shows a critical red warning with instructions to leave the area.
